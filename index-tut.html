      The dashboard serves as your central hub, displaying all tasks that require action from a Project Manager (PM) or Project Assistant (PA). Tasks are prioritized by how long they have exceeded their goal completion time (measured in hours). The aim is to clear all tasks by the end of each business day.

    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      The "1.3 Assign Vendor" report is highlighted as a separate, high-priority section because efficiently assigning vendors to jobs is crucial for smooth operations, customer satisfaction, and timely vendor payments.

    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      <li>The master report should ideally show everything requiring action.</li>
      <li>If a report loads in a "new style" view and doesn't filter by the Task ID, you can click the "New Style" toggle to revert to the old style, which should then filter correctly.</li>

    </h2>
    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      This stage focuses on assigning vendors to new tasks. It's vital for confirming vendor attendance and ensuring they receive necessary information.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">Accessing the Report</h3>
    <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      The 1.3 report can be found at the top of your homepage or within the master report.
    </p>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">Understanding the Display</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      <li>Records are filtered from oldest to newest by creation date on Stage 1.</li>
      <li>Key columns include the assigned Noontide PM, creation date, options to manage/edit the task, related job site address, project end date, work order description, task ID, and a field for notes visible across all stages.</li>
      <li>The customer name and work order type (e.g., emergency response) are also displayed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">Editing a Task</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      <li>Open a record by clicking the pencil icon to edit it.</li>
      <li>The task form shows the project link, project name, assigned Noontide PM, and status (e.g., unassigned).</li>
      <li>Tasks are typically on 1.3 because they are unassigned or no Purchase Order (PO) is required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">Assigning a Vendor</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      <li>Fill in the "vendor is going to site to do" box with the planned work.</li>
      <li>Confirm the job site address is correct.</li>
      <li>Ensure the project is completed by the "project end date." If an extension is needed, confirm with the client.</li>
      <li>Enter the scheduled start date and time for the vendor to attend the site. This information is crucial for clients with secure facilities that require advance notification.</li>
      <li>Check the "Assign to Vendor" box to reveal vendor selection options.</li>
      <li>The system will display vendors and their trades near the job site, along with their preferred vendor rating (0-5), making vendor sourcing more efficient.</li>
      <li>You can filter by trade and search for vendors.</li>
      <li>New, unboarded Walmart vendors will also appear, streamlining the onboarding process.</li>
      <li>Select the company that will perform the work from the dropdown.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">Vendor Payment and Contact</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      <li>If a vendor requires payment before work begins (typically new vendors), check the relevant box.</li>
      <li>Assign the primary vendor contact who will receive the PO and upload the invoice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">Vendor Tech Assignment</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      <li>Assign the technician who will perform the work on-site.</li>
      <li>Ensure the technician's cell phone number is recorded for receiving "Bo" text messages (SMS check-in messages).</li>
      <li>Start notes can be added, which are visible across all reports from 1.3 to 5.1.1.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">Purchase Order (PO) Section</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      <li>If no PO is required, check the "No PO Required" box and set the amount to zero.</li>
      <li>If a PO is required, ensure the box remains unchecked and enter the initial PO amount (e.g., $200). Higher PO amounts may require different approval levels (e.g., PM, GM, COO, CEO).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-4">Final Review and Saving</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
      <li>Before saving, perform a final check:
        <ul className="list-circle list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
          <li>Verify the PO assignment (if applicable).</li>
          <li>Confirm vendor tech information is assigned.</li>

      <li>This report is accessed from the main dashboard or by clicking the 2.0 link within "My Stage 2".</li>
      <li>Its purpose is to confirm vendor attendance at the scheduled time.</li>
      <li>The vendor contact receives the PO and uploads the invoice upon job completion.</li>
      <li>The task description, vendor company details, job site details, and scheduled time and date are displayed.</li>
      <li>Start and end times must be exact due to client requirements for secure facilities.</li>
      <li>The vendor technician (the person performing the work on-site) is assigned and receives "Bo" text messages.</li>
      <li>The technician's cell phone number is mandatory for "Bo" to be sent.</li>
      <li>Start notes are visible on all reports from 1.3 to 5.1.1.</li>
      <li>The PO section displays the PO number and status. A hyperlink allows direct access to the PO.</li>
      <li>The PO status "requested" indicates an issue requiring further attention before "Bo" can be sent.</li>
      <li>The "Link & PO Notifications" section confirms if the technician will receive "Bo".</li>
      <li>You can choose not to send a notification to the customer if the task is primarily for internal system movement.</li>
      <li>You have the option to send "Bo" via email if vendors refuse to provide a cell phone number, but a cell phone number must still be populated for the logic to work.</li>
      <li>"Work Order Acknowledged in Customer System" checkbox needs to be checked after updating customer systems.</li>
      <li>Tasks can be moved to "On Hold" if necessary, but the goal is to push tasks through to completion.</li>

      <li>This report is crucial for ensuring tasks are completed on time.</li>
      <li>Its main function is to track vendor acceptance of "Bo".</li>
      <li>You can access it from the master report or by navigating to "My Stage 2".</li>
      <li>The form is similar to 2.0, with the key difference being that "Bo" has already been sent and the vendor technician is assigned.</li>
      <li>The "SMS Conversations" table should show a green record, indicating "Bo" was successfully sent and is awaiting a response.</li>
      <li>The goal is to have this report cleared by the end of each day by ensuring vendors accept "Bo," moving the task to Stage 3 for same-day jobs or to 2.2 for future-dated jobs.</li>
      <li>Regular follow-up with vendor technicians is necessary to ensure they accept "Bo".</li>
      <li>Training videos are available to assist with understanding "Bo".</li>

      <li>This report serves as your scheduling hub for all work where "Bo" has been sent and accepted by vendors.</li>
      <li>The report should be full at the end of the day, with all other Stage 2 reports empty.</li>
      <li>Tasks can be scheduled for the next day or up to eight months in advance.</li>
      <li>The primary responsibility is to follow up with vendors to confirm they will attend on the scheduled date and time.</li>
      <li>If a vendor cannot attend, the task must be rescheduled.</li>
      <li>Avoid "red" statuses, as these indicate a late or failed task.</li>
      <li>Consistent follow-up with vendors is essential.</li>

      <li>This report indicates that the job is currently in progress, and the vendor is on-site.</li>
      <li>The main objective is to follow up with the vendor to ensure they are on track to complete the job and to encourage them to upload completion images through "Bo".</li>
      <li>If a vendor cannot upload images due to technical issues or refuses to do so, the task can be moved to 2.4.</li>
      <li>No vendors should be left on-site at the end of the day, as this can cause panic and distrust with customers who have access to the system.</li>
      <li>Emphasize to vendors that uploading images promptly leads to faster payment.</li>
      <li>This report requires daily monitoring and follow-up, especially towards the end of the business day.</li>

      <li>Tasks remain on this report if the vendor has not uploaded their completion images via "Bo" or is experiencing difficulties.</li>
      <li>The main actions are to follow up with the vendor regarding "Bo" issues and to obtain images.</li>
      <li>If the vendor is having trouble uploading images, they can email or text them to the Project Manager.</li>
      <li>Three key steps to move a task from 2.4 to Stage 3 (3.1) are:
        <ul className="list-circle list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
          <li>Obtain images from the vendor. You can upload an image from your file explorer, and it will attach to the service report.</li>
          <li>Update the task with the information provided by the vendor.</li>
          <li>Check the "Ready for Review" box in the "Status Breakdown" section. This is the key action that moves the task to 3.1.</li>
        </ul>
